DeepMiner: Empowering Deep Web Exploration and Data Mining
Introduction
In the realm of cybersecurity, research, and IT security, the need for a sophisticated tool to automate the process of navigating the deep web and extracting valuable information is paramount. DeepMiner emerges as a solution, providing a user-friendly, continuously running framework for efficient deep web crawling, searching, and result analysis. This tool caters to testers, researchers, and IT security teams by simplifying the exploration of the deep web and ensuring that the results are both comprehensive and comprehensible.

DeepMiner Features
Continuous and Indefinite Operation
DeepMiner operates continuously and indefinitely, ensuring that its database is consistently updated with the latest information from well-known deep web resources. This feature guarantees that users have access to the most recent and relevant data.

Comprehensive Data Extraction
The tool extracts Onion sites from reputable sources and conducts searches using the extracted HTML content. DeepMiner saves essential information, including site names, directories, HTML details, and connected sites. This data is stored in a SQLite database file, providing users with a structured and easily analyzable format.

Implementation Details
DeepMiner is implemented in Python 3 and has been thoroughly tested on Ubuntu 20.04. Leveraging the power of the SQLite FTS5 Extension, the tool supports both full-text and regex searches for optimal flexibility. Users can further simplify their exploration using the SQLite DB Browser for a graphical interface.
